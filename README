JanRain integration for jump.ios

!!USE AT YOUR OWN PERIL!!

I'm using this in production, but I make no assurances that this will work
in your specific case.

NOTE: JanRain source was modified to ask for the correct permissions.
By default, JanRain only asks for "public_profile" but I neede more and
there was no way to configure. If you don't need this, then change it back
to the default.

Check out near the bottom of JRNativeFacebook.m and add/remove the privileges
as below.

    objc_msgSend(
            fbSession,
            NSSelectorFromString(@"openActiveSessionWithReadPermissions:allowLoginUI:completionHandler:"),
            @[
            @"public_profile",
            @"email",
            @"user_friends",
            @"user_about_me",
            @"user_birthday",
            @"user_location",
            @"user_photos",
            @"read_friendlists"
            ], YES, handler);
